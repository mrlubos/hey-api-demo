<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="node-js" title="Node.js 20 or higher">
    Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
    
    Verify installation:
    ```bash
    node --version
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="npm" title="npm (comes with Node.js)">
    npm is included with Node.js. Verify installation:

### Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mrlubos/hey-api-demo.git
    cd hey-api-demo
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    Install the required npm packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate API client">
    Generate the type-safe API client from the OpenAPI specification:

    ```
    
    This will create all the necessary TypeScript types, SDK methods, and TanStack Query hooks in `src/client/`.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start the development server">
    Run the development server:
